For product fundraisers, please make sure to explain what the products are in the last section as done in the exemplars (before thanking donors of course)

The following are sample WHYS that you can use to create a why for the fundraiser you are preparing for build. Please ensure you double check the following: 
 

 

WHAT is the fundraising product (is that consistently correct in all areas of the why) 
 

 

WHO is fundraising? Ie the client might say Orewa College - but it might be Orewa College Water Polo Team that is fundraising, NOT the whole college so make sure the why is correct 
 

 

HOW - funds raised are going to help this team/school/group  
 

 

HAVE - you made sure the fundraiser page is pitched slightly different, ie this is the voice of the fundraiser, so usually takes a 'first person approach' 
 

 

All content for WHYS is recorded in PROCESS STREET in the Create and manage the "why" content task in the product fundraiser work flow - this is also where the why is edited after the website is live. 
 

 

The following are general sentences that can be added to WHYS, depending on the specific fundraising purpose. Please ensure these sentences are incorporated into the why, when the purpose matches that of the example.
